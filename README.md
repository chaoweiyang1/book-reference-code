Reference code for the [Introduction to GIS Programming and Fundamentals with Python and ArcGIS](https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-GIS-Programming-and-Fundamentals-with-Python-and-ArcGIS/Yang/p/book/9781466510081)

The reference code of each folder is named by its associated chapter of the book. Please refer to each chapter of the text for explainations.

For each chapter, please program in sequence since certain code depends on previous code.

Files prefixed with "code" are meant to be entered line by line into IDLE. The ">>>" indicated which lines will be copied into the IDLE shell.
Images are also supplied for each code snippet to have visual reference for how it would look like in the IDLE shell.
Files prefixed with "run" are meant to be ran standalone to see how the output should look.
